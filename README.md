# Nexter-Landing-Page

Main goal of this project was to build a responsive landing page by using the CSS Grid layout method.

Besides grid, the project uses SVG icons instead of iconfont, Block Element Modifier (BEM) methodology, responsive design and some handy CSS tricks and helpful online tools.
